# PokerEye Plus for Ignition Casino
 PokerEye+ (Plus) for Ignition Casino - An easy-to-use Chrome extension that records & calculates statistics while playing on Ignition Casino's Online Poker in your browser. (This extension can easily be customized to work on Bodog and Bovada's Online Poker as well, since they all use the same licensed PokerAPI software)

Just paste the contents of [`chrome-extension/main.js`](https://github.com/vuolo/PokerEye-Plus-for-Ignition-Casino/blob/main/chrome-extension/main.js) into your console. If you want the best pre-flop move automatically calculated using [Jonathan Little's PokerCoaching.com Preflop Charts](https://poker-coaching.s3.amazonaws.com/tools/preflop-charts/online-6max-gto-charts.pdf), just run the api as well (Next.js + tRPC backend).
